# Small e-comerce site made with react

This page is a little e-comerce platform which uses the JSON RESTFUL API as its backend. The page is fully functional, except that the amount of any product can't be changed (JSON typicode server restriction). However, to see that a "PATCH request" has been made, you can open your console (the functional key F12) and there check out the object that is displayed there.

This page is fully responsive and available on all platforms.

You can find the working version of this page:
* [here](https://jean-pierrenovak0612.github.io/ecomerce-site/#/ecomerce-site/ecomerce-site/)

or you can clone this repository, download the neccessary packages by using the command:

* npm i
or 
* npm install 

and then start the page by using the command:

* npm start
